STL-Core
===
`STL-Core` is a version of the CLI Flag Parser where the only components available are the `string` and `vector` headers. <br>

Excluding the usage of `argc`/`argv` indefinitely. <br>

The purpose behind this is to see how long, and how difficult it would be, to create a basic CLI flag parser by only using the core components of the language (again, excluding `argc`/`argv`).
