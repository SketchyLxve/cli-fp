STL CLI Flag Parser
===
This version of the parser is achieved by only using the core components of C++, such as the `string` & `vector` headers, as well as `argc` and `argv`, which is "baked" into the language itself. <br>

Originally, the idea was to build the parser from scratch, with the addition of using only the aforementioned headers. Though, the idea was absolutely ridiculuous and would take a lot of time (which is not a resource available to me during this period) and is incredibly difficult. <br>

However, it will come out eventually, under the branch `stl-core`.

Special thank you to a friend of mine, nicknamed `Cheeze`, for bringing this idea up.
