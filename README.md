Flag Parser
=== 
FP (a better name coming soon) is a minuscule parser which extracts all flags, options, & such, from a specified input. <br>
The main component of it is Regex. However, regular expressions in C++ do not have `global` support. <br>

Which is why there is a designated method using recursion in order to find all matches in the string. <br>
It was the most efficient way of doing it I could possibly think of, as this was written by a beginner.

Inspiration
===
The main inspiration for this project was [1Compu](https://github.com/1Computer1)'s parser/utility for non-technical user input â€” [Lexure](https://github.com/1Computer1/lexure) <br>
This idea is in no way original, however it is not a complete replica / remake of the aforementioned.
